A mini project involving django authentication. It consists of a app with register and login page.
By default, Django uses the PBKDF2 algorithm with a SHA256 hash, a password stretching mechanism recommended by NIST. 
The same is used here. Its quite secure and requires massive amount of computing time for breaking.
